# responsivePortfolio

This was a challenging homework at the beginning. My first draft took me almost 8hrs to finish. 
While chatting with the TA's after class, they gave me lots of tips. 
Although, my tutor Jeremy Jones, showed me pointers I would have completely missed, which caused me to re-do my whole code. 

What you see now are 50% less code than when I started this homework. I feel completely accomplished. 


About the CODE:
AboutMe, was simple, just created a container and 3 rows where all my content went to. 
My footer, I Simply fixed-bottom, still playing with that, I feel there are simpler ways to do. Also my footer takes the spand of the whole screen. 
From here, I simply copy and pasted the container and footer as I wanted everything to have a similar look. 

Goes like:
Container - 
1st Row (Header)
2nd Row (NavBar)
3rd Row (Seconday header regarding my body)
4th Row (Body) 

Footer was simply, just added class names to be responsive to bootstrap. 

I copy and pasted the following to my portfolio.html and contact.html
  -Container-
  1st Row
  2nd Row
  3rd Row
  Footer

The body changed from page to page as content needed to be different to reflect tittle. 

Hope I get feedback to help me be better.
