# responsivePortfolio

This was a challenging homework assignment at the beginning. 
My first draft took me almost 8hrs to finish. 
While chatting with the TA's after class, they gave me lots of tips. 
My tutor Jeremy Jones, showed me amazing pointers I would have otherwise completely missed, which caused me to re-do my whole code. 

What you see now is 50% less code than when I started. I feel completely accomplished. 


About the CODE:
AboutMe, was simple, just created a container and 4 rows within the container. 

My footer, being honest, i gave up and left as is. It takes over the whole legnth of the screen. And not the same length of the container.  

My code from top to bottom. 
Goes like:
Linked the bootstrap link to my page
linked my css file

in the body, simply did this. 
Container - 
1st Row (Header)
2nd Row (NavBar)
3rd Row (Seconday header regarding my body)
4th Row (Body) 

Footer, just added class names to be responsive to bootstrap. 

I copy and pasted the following to my portfolio.html and contact.html
  -Container-
  1st Row
  2nd Row
  3rd Row
  Footer

The body changed from page to page as content needed to be different to reflect tittle. 

Hope I get feedback to help me be better.
